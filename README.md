# Getting-Job-Posts-using-Hacker-News-API
When the project loads there will be 9 job posts shown with a load more button, the load more will show 6 new job posts on each click. The hacker news API returns an array of ids of job posts. By using the second API and concatenating each id, we get the data of each job post.
